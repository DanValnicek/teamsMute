# MSTeamsMute
Python script for muting MS Teams with the Pause key.

# Installation

`xdotools` is required for this to work.

# Usage

I use this script to switch mute between Discord and MS Teams.
In discord I have shortcut for muting set to Pause key and in GNOME I've set shortcut on Pause key also so it runs this script.

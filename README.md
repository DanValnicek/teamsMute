# MSTeamsMute
Python script for muting MS Teams.

# Installation

`xdotools` and `wmctrl` is required for this script to work.
Download this script and run it.

# Usage

I use this script to switch mute between Discord and MS Teams.
In discord I have shortcut for muting set to Pause key and in GNOME I've set shortcut on Pause key also so it runs this script with Discord mute.
